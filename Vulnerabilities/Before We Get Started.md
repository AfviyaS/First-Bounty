Before jumping into vulnerabilities, you need to get comfortable with `Burp Suite`.

Burp is the main tool used by bug bounty hunters to intercept, modify, and replay HTTP requests. It's way more powerful than Postman (which you should be familiar with by now), and it lets you see how web apps actually work under the hood.

At this stage, you donâ€™t need to master every feature. Just learn enough to start testing:

- Intercept and view HTTP requests and responses
- Modify parameters and forward requests
- Use Repeater to manually test different inputs
- Explore HTTP history to review what you've done

The resources below will get you started:
